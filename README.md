LibBMP085
===========
Libbmp085 is a simple, easy to use C library for communication with Bosh BMP085 barometric pressure and temperature sensor
on Linux. It provides access to the BMP085 sensor from the userspace through the /dev interface. 
Module i2c-dev must be loaded before library use.

The library implements functions for: connecting to BMP085 sensor over I2C bus; reading the sensor calibration table; 
initiates temperature and pressure measurement; reads measured values from the sensor. It supports all BMP085 modes 
of operation.

Installation
---------------
Installation instruction can be found in the INSTALL file.

Test Hardware
---------------
Tested on Raspberry Pi model B Revision 1 board with Adafruit BMP085 module (Adafruit product ID 391).
The library is distributed with an example program that demonstrates the library use for temperature and barometric pressure measurement.
